# Clash Caller Url Tool
This is supersimple tool to help people who play clash of clans and use clashcaller to manage wars to simplify navigation to wars.
Problem with usage of clashcaller is the need to communicate game codes(ex:'zxcvb') to everyone before the game.

This tool after set up allows players to use 1 url for the games and it allows admins to replace underlying clashcaller ids though very basic frontend. 

Technology behind this stuff: 
Backend uses AWS Lambda API
Frontend uses JQuery and hosted in AWS S3 bucket
